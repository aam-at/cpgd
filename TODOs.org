#+TITLE: Todos for cpgd project

* TODOs
** Mnist experiments
*** DONE Import MNIST challenge model
CLOSED: [2020-02-07 Fri 17:22]
This model was already used in fab-paper.
** General algorithm
*** TODO Test different schedules to reduce sampling radius
Plot with summary the average perturbation norm and observe what is crucial
(rapid decay of the radius or having a search within large radius)
**** Test the strategy where we decrease the radius and where we keep radius constant
Fab used the fixed radius for sampling
**** TODO Implement where initial const is computed on a random batch from the dataset
Instead of using constant C compute C on the random batch and use for all
consecutive runs
**** TODO Compare different stopping thresholds
Experiments how does the stopping thresholds impacts the performance vs
different number of iterations
*** TODO Implement Projected FISTA algorithm for l1 optimization
*** TODO Implement linf algorithm
** TODO Cifar10 experiments
*** TODO Import Cifar10 challenge model
** TODO Imagenet experiments
*** TODO Import robust model trained on Restricted Imagenet
** Main parameters of the algorithm
- Number of iterations
- Minimum number of iterations before restarting if the stopping condition is satisfied
- Maximum number of iterations before random restart
- Threshold for the first order optimality conditions
- Initial const for optimization
- Learning rate for primal and dual variables
* Paper experiments
** Robustness MNIST
** Robustness CIFAR10
** Robustness Imagenet
** Robustness to corruptions
