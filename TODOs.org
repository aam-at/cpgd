#+TITLE: Todos for cpgd project

* TODOs
** General algorithm [8/8]
*** DONE Test different schedules to reduce sampling radius
CLOSED: [2020-02-28 Fri 04:28]
Plot with summary the average perturbation norm and observe what is crucial
(rapid decay of the radius or having a search within large radius)
Use simple random sampling (random random fixed radius)
**** Test the strategy where we decrease the radius and where we keep radius constant
Fab used the fixed radius for sampling
**** TODO Implement where initial const is computed on a random batch from the dataset
Instead of using constant C compute C on the random batch and use for all
consecutive runs
**** TODO Compare different stopping thresholds
Experiments how does the stopping thresholds impacts the performance vs
different number of iterations
*** DONE Implement Projected FISTA algorithm for l1 optimization
CLOSED: [2020-03-26 Thu 15:06]
Implemented accelerated proximal gradient
*** DONE Implement linf algorithm
CLOSED: [2020-02-28 Fri 04:28]
*** DONE Use iterative thresholding algorithm instead of previous clipping
CLOSED: [2020-02-28 Fri 04:28]
*** DONE Implement tuning for specific thresholds
CLOSED: [2020-03-26 Thu 15:06]
Doesn't work well  Make whole algorithm a little bit more
complicated.
Set it instead to the small value, like the problem is unconstrained
*** DONE Implement fista with sgd
CLOSED: [2020-03-26 Thu 15:06]
*** DONE Implement fista with backtracking
CLOSED: [2020-03-26 Thu 15:06]
*** DONE Make a connection to multiplicative updates external regret minimization
CLOSED: [2020-03-26 Thu 15:06]
** Mnist experiments [4/4]
*** DONE Import MNIST challenge model
CLOSED: [2020-02-07 Fri 17:22]
